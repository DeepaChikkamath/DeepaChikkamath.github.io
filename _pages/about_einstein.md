Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.


I am a fifth year BS-MS student at [IISER Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/) majoring in Physics. I started with interest in astrophysics, but wanted to explore other fields. So I worked in condensed matter physics, experimental quantum optics, fluid dynamics, classical and quantum turbulence. I have previously worked as a research intern at [IISER Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/), [IIT Dharwad](https://www.iitdh.ac.in/), [Côte d'Azur Observatory - Nice](https://www.oca.eu/fr/). 

For my final year master's thesis, I am studying oscillations in turbulence under the guidance of Prof. Stéphane Perrard at [Laboratoire PMMH](https://www.pmmh.espci.fr/-Le-laboratoire-), [ESPCI Paris](https://www.espci.psl.eu/en/). For this, I won the Indo-Thai Fellowship organised by the Fonds ESPCI in collaboration with Michelin Corporate Foundation.

My projects have lead my interests more into fluid dynamics, superconductivity, quantum fluids.
