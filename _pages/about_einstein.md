I am a fifth year BS-MS student at [IISER Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/) majoring in Physics. I started with interest in astrophysics, but wanted to explore other fields. So I worked in condensed matter physics, experimental quantum optics, fluid dynamics, classical and quantum turbulence. I have previously worked as a research intern at [IISER Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/), [IIT Dharwad](https://www.iitdh.ac.in/), [Côte d'Azur Observatory - Nice](https://www.oca.eu/fr/). 

For my final year master's thesis, I am studying oscillations in turbulence under the guidance of Prof. Stéphane Perrard at [Laboratoire PMMH](https://www.pmmh.espci.fr/-Le-laboratoire-), [ESPCI Paris](https://www.espci.psl.eu/en/). For this, I won the Indo-Thai Fellowship organised by the Fonds ESPCI in collaboration with Michelin Corporate Foundation.

My projects have lead my interests more into fluid dynamics, superconductivity, quantum fluids.
