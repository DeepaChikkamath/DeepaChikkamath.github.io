The results we found will be compared to the ones found for quantum turbulence (The Gross-Pitaevskii equation) in two dimensions. Learnt the theory of turbulence and used Matlab for 2D incompressible and compressible fluid models and calculated energy cascades, circulation, palinstrophy and enstrophy."]
