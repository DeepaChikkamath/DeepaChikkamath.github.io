I worked on understanding the role of compressibility in turbulent fluctuations in a two-dimensional fluid model (The Navier-Stokes equation). The results we found will be compared to the ones found for quantum turbulence (The Gross-Pitaevskii equation) in two dimensions. Learnt the theory of turbulence and used Matlab for 2D incompressible and compressible fluid models and calculated energy cascades, circulation, palinstrophy and enstrophy."]},{"name":"Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Dharwad","position":"Research Intern","startDate":"05/2023","endDate":"07/2023","highlights":["I worked under the guidance of Prof. Hiranya Deka on the theoretical and numerical modelling of the sealing dynamics of a drop impact on a liquid film.
